# What is opretaor in C?

### one of the features in C which has symbols that can be used to perform mathematical, relational, bitwise, conditional, or logical manipulations. The C programming language has a lot of built-in operators to perform various tasks as per the need of the program.

# C divides the operators into the following groups:

## Arithmetic operators
#### Used for mathematical operations   
#### We have unary and binary operators
#### Unary – ( ++, --)
#### Binary – (+ , - , *, /, %)

## Assignment operators
#### It is used to assign a value to a given variable.
#### The value on the right side of the assignment operator is assigned to operand at left side.
#### We also have some short hand assignment operators ( +=, -=, /=

## Comparison operators
#### Used to compare the values of two operands
#### Some of them are ( < , <= , >=, ==)
#### We can also check for equality of operands, whether an operand is greater or smaller than the other.

## Logical operators
#### To combine one or multiple conditions we can use Logical operators.
#### Logical operators always give us a Boolean value, i.e. true or false
#### Some of them are ( && - AND, || - OR, ! – NOT)

## Bitwise operators
#### We can perform bit-level operations on the operands.
#### Some of them are ( & - bitwise AND, |- bitwise OR)
#### It converts them to bit-level first and then performs the operations

## Sizeof Operator
#### The memory size (in bytes) of a data type or a variable can be found with the ```sizeof``` operator
